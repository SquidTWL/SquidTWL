GBATEK is almost a good resource, except it just drops random non-standard terms on you constantly 
without explanation and it also uses these terms incorrectly in different sections - ESPECIALLY
between the GBA/DS sections!

This is a quick document I've written up to demystify some of the terminology it uses.

Tilemaps
--------

- Character means "tile". Text means "tiles". I have no fucking idea why it calls them characters
  or text!

- Dots means pixels.

- 1D vs 2D means treating video tiles as either linear (1D) or offset by a constant amount (2D).
